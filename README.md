This is a simple application for fetching a list of users from the github api and allowing you to
infinitely scroll down through them.

Additionally you can click into a user and see their repositories and when you click the
repositories you can see three of their commits for that repository. I did not use dagger 2 as the
size of the project and simplicity didn't require it. Below is a video of the app being used.
